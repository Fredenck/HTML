    <h2>The Life of a Cupcake:</h2>
    <blockquote>They put me in the oven to bake.
        Me, a deprived and miserable cake.
        Feeling the heat, I started to bubble.
        Watching the others, I knew I was in trouble.

        They opened the door and I started my life.
        Frosting me with a silver knife,
        Decorating me with candy jewels.
        The rest of my batch looked like fools.

        Lifting me up, she took off my wrapper.
        Feeling the breeze, I wanted to slap her.
        Opening her mouth with shiny teeth inside,
        This was the day this cupcake died.
